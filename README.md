# simple_shell üíª

## Description
This program is shell-based, that is, it behaves like a command line interpreter. Like Shell, this program receives input, interprets it for the operating system, and manages the output.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yuriquezada/simple_shell.git
    ```
2. Locate ourselves in the root folder of the directory.
    
3. Inside the simple_shell folder, run the following command:
    ```
    valgrind  gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o shell
    ```
4. Finally run the program by typing the following:
    ```
    ./shell
    ```
    The output of the new shell is the following:
    ```
    julien@ubuntu:~/shell$./shell
    $
    ```
